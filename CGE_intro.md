## Reference materials for building CGE models  

### [Intro(Chinese)](reference/intro.pdf)
This literature review breifly introduces CGE models and its pros & cons.       

### [Workflow(BU)](reference/BU.pdf)
This is the first item appears in "CGE model in energy" google search, and it's quite helpful.
Section 2 and 3 explain the fundamental idea of CGE models. Section 7-8 provide field-specific modeling techniques in energy and environment. Section 4 - 6 are about details constructing the model(you should skip them).

### [Other models](reference/duke.pdf)
Manual for Duke University's DIEM-CGE model. There are many different CGE framework for energy & environment applications. [Review](reference/review.pdf)This paper provides a recent review on these models. 

### [Reform](reference/reform.pdf) ['Price'](reference/price.pdf)

These are the papers that I have referred to in my proposal.
